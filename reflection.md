- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is named Adventurer and it implements the Contract interface. This class represents an adventurer who explores and interacts with the environment using the methods defined in the interface. In this Adventurer class, each method from the Contract interface is implemented to perform actions an adventurer might take in an adventure game. For example, picking up items, examining the surroundings, moving to different locations, using items, and more.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- I included getter and setter methods for retrieving and updating the current location and health of the adventurer.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- This was great practice for our upcoming final project and I think its really useful to understand this assignment.
